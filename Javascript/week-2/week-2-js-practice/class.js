// Classes in JS

// Primitive Types. 
// 1. Number. 
// 2. String. 
// 3. Boolean. 

// Complex Types. 
// 1. Objects. 
// 2. Arrays.

// This is the Javascript Objects.

Key Concepts:
Class Declaration:
You declare a class using the class keyword.
Inside a class, you define properties (variables) and methods (functions) that will belong to the objects created from this class.
Constructor: A special method inside the class that is called when you create an instance (an object) of the class. Itâ€™s used to initialize the properties of the object.
Methods: Functions that are defined inside the class and can be used by all instances of the class.
Inheritance: Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing you to create a new class based on an existing one.
Static Methods: Methods that belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. You call them directly on the class.
Getters and Setters: Special methods that allow you to define how properties are accessed and modified.
